# ftw.openlayerhotfix

In the current version of collective.geo.openlayers the google roadmap is broken. This is due to a google api update.
Updates OpenLayers.js to a dev version which can handle the new api.

Installed OpenLayers Version: `2.14 dev (11.01.2016)` 
Source: http://dev.openlayers.org/OpenLayers.js
